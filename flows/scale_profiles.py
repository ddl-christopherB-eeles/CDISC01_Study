"""Study-file profiles for the DOM-79203 Flows Artifact Export test.

Folder file counts and sizes come from the customer file-size report attached
to DOM-79203, rounded up. `full` reproduces the report, including its largest
file (supplb.sas7bdat, about 11 GiB). `regular` keeps the same folder mix at a
small fraction of the files and bytes so it can run in the standard suite.
